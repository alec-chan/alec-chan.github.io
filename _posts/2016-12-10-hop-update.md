description: 2D characters in the 3D world

After a long break, I've started working on Hop again.  After removing all the bloated net code and basically completely restarting the project, things run a lot smoother.  

Here's a short video of a 2D Ricky navigating in the 3D world.

The animation control code, camera flow, character physics and a lot of other things need to be fixed up... in general it's really glitchy right now, but I was surprised how easy it was to get my 2D character controller to interact properly with the 3D environment.
