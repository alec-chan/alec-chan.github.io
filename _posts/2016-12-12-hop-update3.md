New today:

+ Rainboi
+ Rainboi Walk, Jump, Wallclimb animations
+ Ricky shield restricted to [90,-90]&deg; angle, and changed to 8 directional rotation instead of 360 degree free rotation
+ Pesh AI (Patrol and shoot on sight + some crappy particle effect animations)
+ Removed shield slide
+ Ricky's shield trampoline (hold shield at 90&deg; to allow rainboi to bounce off of it)

- Restrict shield trampoline permissions (in the video, you can see that the pesh is able to bounce off the trampoline)
- Improve AI
- Add all Rainboi animations
- Rainboi attacks

Later On:
