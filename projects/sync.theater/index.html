      <h3>What is sync.theater?</h3>

	    <p>sync.theater is essentially an online movie theater.  You can go to <a href="http://sync.theater/">sync.theater</a>, queue up some videos and share your room link with your friends and the videos that you queue up will be played in sync to everyone in the room.</p>
        <p>This app started as a personal project for friends to watch movies together online without having to worry about someone getting ahead or behind. Now, it has about 10-20 daily users and is continuously growing.</p>
        <p>sync.theater is built on a C# backend which communicates with clients over websockets. In addition to the C# websocket server, a python video extraction server, which helps scrape webpages for video urls to embed, is part of the stack. All of these services run on a t2.micro AWS EC2 server.</p>
	    <p>sync.theater is probably my largest project, at about 1.7k lines of code (excluding external libraries).  It is a solo project developed based around community feedback.</p>
