      <h3>Story</h3>

	  <p>John Herrin survived in a horrible accident and in the result, he lost his memory. He doesn't remember what happened and what lead to such a terrible catastrophe. Now, it's up to Dr. Rick Norberg and the friendly robot AB to restore his broken memory. The only way John can restore his memory is by sleeping and rediscovering the past in his dreams, but because of his brain damage, John starts to see hallucinations, hear strange sounds and falling asleep won't be as easy as it seems. He'll have to calm himself to fall asleep, otherwise the overwhelming stress might give him an heart attack.</p>

	  
	  <h3>Mechanics</h3>

	  <p>To check his current state, there is an "Info Panel", which displays John's "Stress level" and "Sleep level". Too many hallucinations and "paranormal activities" can cause John's "Stress level" to rise and if it reaches 100%, John will get a heart attack and the game will be over. The "Sleep level" can show how close John is to sleeping and if it reaches 100%, John will fall asleep. Close your eyes and keep them shut to raise it. By turning on light, you can lower the stress level quicker and by hiding in the blanket you can make the hallucinations go away.</p>
